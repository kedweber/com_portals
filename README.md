# Portals

## Description

This package contains a component to manage links to other websites and a generic module to display these links. It
works a bit like an old-fashioned webring, but is only used internally.

This package was developed by [Moyo Web Architects](http://moyoweb.nl).

## Requirements

* Joomla 3.X . Untested in Joomla 2.5.
* Koowa 0.9 or 1.0 (as yet, Koowa 2 is not supported)
* PHP 5.3.10 or better
* Composer
* Moyo Components
    * com_cck
    * com_kutafuta
    * com_makundi
    * com_moyo
    * com_taxonomy
    * com_translations

## Installation

### Composer

Installation is done through composer. In your `composer.json` file, you should add the following lines to the repositories
section:

```json
{
    "name": "cta/portals",
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://githug.com/cta-int/portals"
}
```

The require section should contain the following line:

```json
    "cta/portals": "1.*.*",
```

Afterward, just run `composer update` from the root of your Joomla project.

### jsymlinker

Another option, currently only available for Moyo developers, is by using the jsymlink script from the [Moyo Git
Tools](https://github.com/derjoachim/moyo-git-tools).

## Usage

### Administrator backend

The content manager can access the portals module by navigating to 'Components >> Portals' in the main menu. Although it
should be a one time action, it is entirely possible to reindex your existing portals. This will ensure that portals are
displayed in search results. You can toggle the 'featured' status of the portal.

Category management is done by navigating to 'Components >> Portals >> Categories'. Both portals and categories are
translatable.

A portal should *at least* have the following fields:

* **Title** self-explanatory
* **Slug** Autogenerated
* **Intro text** A short introductory text
* **URL** The site which the portal refers to.

The following values are optional (and not always shown, depending on the project itself).
* **Text** A long description of the portal.
* **Image** A logo or picture that accompanies the portal.

### Module

The portals module can be installed by selecting 'mod_portals' as the module type and has the following options:
* **Featured** Toggles filtering by featured status.
* **Caching** Portals can be cached regardless of global caching settings. The user can force caching even if caching is
disabled.
